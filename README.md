# Minisumo-board-M87-Model
Minisumo PCB
First Minisumo control board developed and implemented by Team Crusaders. The design is based on the ESP32-C3 microcontroller and the TB6612FNG dual motor driver.
The board is powered by a 3S LiPo battery (11.1V nominal), ensuring high current delivery and strong dynamic response during competition. It supports up to four sensors and is capable of operating in both RC (Remote-Controlled) and fully autonomous mode.
